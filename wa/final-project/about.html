                <p class="nunito-body">
                    I was born and raised in Hotchkiss, Colorado. Growing up in such a small town
                    has really shaped the way I view community and what it means to me. At CU Boulder, 
                    I regularly put this perspective into practice as a peer mentor for the Lattice Program, 
                    where I am able to foster a close-knit community and support first-generation students 
                    in the program. I also worked as a mentor for the EngiNearMe program over the summer, 
                    where I was able to encourage high school students to explore STEM at the university. 
                </p>

                <p class="nunito-body">
                    When I began my journey at CU Boulder, I majored in Computer Science. Over time, I 
                    realized that the program felt too technical for me, so I made the decision to pursue 
                    Creative Technology & Design instead. To me, CTD is the best of both worlds. I’m still 
                    able to work with technology, but I also have the opportunity to express myself creatively 
                    and connect with others in what seem like a more human-centered environment.

                <p class="nunito-body">
                    Through these experiences, I’ve developed skills in C++ programming, 3D modeling 
                    (SketchUp and Blender), and design tools such as Photoshop. I enjoy using these skills 
                    and more to help bring my ideas to life. While my interests are currently broad, I’m excited 
                    to explore them further and narrow my focus as I progress in my degree.
