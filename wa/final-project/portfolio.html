                    <p class="small-summary">
                        A semester-long UX redesign of the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo’s “Buying a Ticket” flow, focused on improving clarity, 
                        reducing confusion, and creating a more user-friendly experience.

                            For this project I focused on reimagining the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo’s ticket-buying experience. Through 
                            usability testing, I found users felt the original flow felt very cluttered and at points, borderline 
                            difficult to navigate, especially for non-tech savvy families trying to plan a visit. I also worked on 
                            strengthening the visual hierarchy and designing a layout that feels more accessible. My Redesign aimed to simplify 
                            the process by creating a clearer distinction between ticket paths, improving the date and time selection screen, and 
                            improving the home screen layout.

                    <h3>Chess Set Model</h3>
                    <p class="small-summary">I designed a portable chess set that could act as both the game board, and as storage for it.</p>

                            For this project, I designed a woodlands-inspired chess set and created 3D models of the six game pieces. 
                            The original concept came with many challenges. I originally planned to build it out of wood by cutting and 
                            gluing each component, but the sliding-lid mechanism proved to be difficult to assemble. To solve for this, I 
                            redesigned the board using a laser-cutting approach, which allowed for me to standardize the entire board using 
                            a laser-cutting approach ensuring each piece fit together cleanly.

                            I modeled the six chess pieces in Blender and designed the board structure in SketchUp. This combination of 3D 
                            modeling helped me refine the fabrication of the final design.

                    <h3>Zine Cover</h3>
                    <p class="small-summary">I designed a magazine cover themed around surveillance and panopticism. Using a blue and red 
                        color palette, surreal imagery, and typography I achieved this look.

                            I designed a magazine cover that aimed to explore themes of surveillance, privacy, and panopticism. I wanted the cover to feel
                            unsettling, but clean by using a red and blue color palette. I made use of repeated eyes to represent the survelliance and a hand holding
                            the "I" in the cover title. I think this use of negative space helped to create the tone I was looking for.
