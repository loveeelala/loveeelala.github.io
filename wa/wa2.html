        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in a small town in Hotchkiss,CO. It's here where I learned
            about my love for art and design, and was able to integrate it with some basic html. 
            I am currently a Junior at the University of Colorado Boulder and am majoring in Creative 
            Technology and Design. I have a lot of interest in creating and designing, particularly when
            in 3D designing, which I got into spring '25.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <h3>Academic</h3>
            <p>I want to get my Bachelors in Creative Technology and Design. I want to find something
                to minor in and get a few certificates before I graduate in order to enhance my abilities
                and make the most of my time at CU.
            </p>
        <h3>Personal</h3>
            <p>
                I want to find what my passion is exactly and work towards that. I'm currently still
                learning the basics and hope to do more with what I learn.
            </p>
        <h3>Professional</h3>
            <p>
                I hope to get an internship by next summer or be able to be a part of projects to get some
                hands on experience.
            </p>
