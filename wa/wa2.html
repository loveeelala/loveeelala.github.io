        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Hotchkiss, Colorado. Growing up in such a small
        town has really shaped the way I view community and what it means to me. I 
        am currently a peer mentor for the Lattice program, where I get to put this
        perspective into practice by fostering connection and supporting first-generation students.
        I’m also a junior at the University of Colorado Boulder, majoring in Creative Technology and Design. I have experience with C++ programming, 3D modeling
        In Blender, and traditional drawing. I enjoy using these skills and more to help 
        bring my ideas to life. While my interests are currently broad, I’m excited
        to explore them further and narrow my focus as I progress in my degree.
        </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <h3>Academic</h3>
            <p>I want to get my Bachelors in Creative Technology and Design. I also hope to pursue
                a minor and earn a few certificates before I graduate in order to enhance my abilities
                and make the most of my time at CU.
            </p>
        <h3>Personal</h3>
            <p>
                I want to find what my passion is exactly and work towards that. I'm currently still
                learning the basics and hope to do more with what I learn.
            </p>
        <h3>Professional</h3>
            <p>
                I hope to secure an internship by next summer or contribute to projects to get some
                hands on experience.
            </p>
