    <h2>This is my reflection</h2>

    <p>
        When choosing my colors, I knew I wanted red to be one of them because I think it strongly represents my Mexican-American 
        heritage. I chose a darker, almost burgundy red to reflect on the aspects of my culture that were often hidden or 
        underrepresented while growing up in a predominantly white town. As I’ve grown older, I’ve begun to explore and embrace my
         cultural identity more fully, and I like to think that this aged, rich red feels authentic to me. As for the other colors
          in my palette, the off-white, pink, and green, I think they’re all representative of my personality: light, bright, and 
          full of energy. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Accessibility had a pretty significant impact on my design decisions. I had to adjust my color palette several times to 
        make sure I met the WCAG contrast requirements. It was challenging to balance colors that I felt were personally 
        representative of who I was with the need for accessibility, but I am satisfied with my final palette. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I think what surprised me the most was the most visual part of this assignment, which was the color palette. I originally 
        thought this would be an easy assignment I could turn in within a few hours, but I spent a lot of time thinking of which 
        colors I wanted to represent who I am, and more importantly which colors I use for different parts of the website such as 
        dark red for text, off-white for the background, pink and green for the accents. I think I will apply this system by using
         what I have learned about myself and accessibility to create something that is suitable for both. I will say, I was also 
         surprised to learn that implementing button/link styles isn’t as challenging as I had expected and had fun learning about 
         them.
    </p>

    <p>
        I think I will expand/refine this system for different contexts by experimenting with different usage of colors/typography
         especially when it comes to blending who I am with aspects of accessibility. The parts that feel the least flexible are 
         the accent and background colors I chose because changing them could really impact readability and accessibility, and 
         they’re already limiting in my color palette regarding what I can and can’t use them for. The parts that feel the most 
         flexible are the dark red color and the typography scale as I can adjust them for different contexts.
