                <p>I was born and raised in Hotchkiss, Colorado. Growing up in such a small
                town has really shaped the way I view community and what it means to me. I 
                am currently a peer mentor for the Lattice program, where I get to put this
                perspective into practice by fostering connection and supporting first-generation students.
                I’m also a junior at the University of Colorado Boulder, majoring in Creative Technology and Design. I have experience with C++ programming, 3D modeling
                In Blender, and traditional drawing. I enjoy using these skills and more to help 
                bring my ideas to life. While my interests are currently broad, I’m excited
                to explore them further and narrow my focus as I progress in my degree.
