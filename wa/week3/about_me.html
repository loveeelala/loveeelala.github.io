                I was born and raised in Hotchkiss, Colorado. Growing up in such a small town
                 has really shaped the way I view community and what it means to me. At CU Boulder, 
                 I regularly put this perspective into practice as a peer mentor for the Lattice Program, 
                 where I am able to foster a close-knit community and support first-generation students 
                 in the program. I also worked as a mentor for the EngiNearMe program over the summer, 
                 where I was able to encourage high school students to explore STEM at the university.

                When I began my journey at CU Boulder, I majored in Computer Science. Over time, I 
                realized that the program felt too technical for me, so I made the decision to pursue 
                Creative Technology & Design instead. To me, CTD is the best of both worlds. I’m still 
                able to work with technology, but I also have the opportunity to express myself creatively 
                and connect with others in what seem like a more human-centered environment.

                Through these experiences, I’ve developed skills in C++ programming, 3D modeling 
                (SketchUp and Blender), and design tools such as Photoshop. I enjoy using these skills 
                and more to help bring my ideas to life. While my interests are currently broad, I’m excited 
                to explore them further and narrow my focus as I progress in my degree.
